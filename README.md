# Notes
A repo with all my study notes on books, lectures, courses and articles

## Books
I read all books in electronic format. I use a Kindle to read novels and I highlight like a maniac. Not only does this help me pay more attention to what I'm reading, but also helps me summarize what I read at the end of the book. For other books in which I need to takes notes as I go along, I use my PC.

## Course Lectures
I watch almost all content at 1.5x. I usually take notes along the video, sometimes pausing in between if I need to.

## Taking Notes
I use VSCode to take notes and use the [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension.

Taking notes slows down quite a lot the amount of stuff I can ingest, but I found out it really helps me retain knowledge in the long-term. It allows me to come back, review and even share concepts that could be long forgotten otherwise, the slow intake trade-off is compensated.
