# [Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus and Satisfaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU&t=20s&ab_channel=AndrewHuberman)

## What Dopamine (Really) Does

- There is a baseline level of dopamine which is generally circulating around your body which determines your mood and how you're feeling.
- When you crave something really desirable, you experience a peak in dopamine level, post which the baseline level of dopamine drops.

## How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly

- Taking supplements for Dopamine might not be the best idea because while it may make you feel more excited and motivated about things, it will also make that motivation very short-lived.
- This is because the excitement or motivation does not depend on the height of the peak, but the height of the peak relative to the baseline.
- If you increase the baseline and increase the peak, you will not experience more pleasure.

## Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine

- When dopamine is released, it will bind to the next neuron and will set up a cascade. This is a slower process.
- Your experience of life and your level of motivation and drive depends on how much dopamine you have relative to your recent experience.

## Activities That Increase Dopamine

- *Chocolate* causes a 1.5x increase.
- Both pursuit and act of *sex* causes 2x increase.
- *Nicotine* increases 2.5x and it is very short-lived.
- *Cocaine* increases it 2.5x times and *amphetamines* increase it 10x times.
- People who like *exercise* will experience 2x times increase and those who don't like it experience little to no increase in dopamine.
- Regular ingestion of *caffeine* increases regulation of certain dopamine receptors, which means it makes you able to experience more of dopamine's effects.

## Pursuit, Excitement and Your "Dopamine Setpoint"

- After we reach a peak in dopamine, a drop in baseline occurs, and it always takes a little while to get back up to our stable baseline.
- The _stable baseline_ is our _dopamine setpoint_.

## Your Pleasure-Pain Balance & Defining “Pain”

- If we really like chocolate and eat a piece of it, we experience pleasure but then there's a little bit of pain that exceeds the amount of pain, and it's subtle.
- We experience that pain as wanting more of that thing (chocolate in this case).
- This pain is coming from the lack of dopamine that follows.
