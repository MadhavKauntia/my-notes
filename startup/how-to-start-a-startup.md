## Idea

- Investors prefer to invest a small but rapidly growing market.
- Have an answer to the questions **_Why now?_**

## Product

- Build a great product first with the feedback of the users. Everything else like PR, recruiting, partnerships comes after that.
- Build a product that a small number of users love rather than a product which a large number of users like.
- Start with something simple. Even if your eventual plans are super complex (which they should be), you can always start with a smaller subset of the problem.

1. Show if to users
2. User Feedback

- What do they like?
- What would they pay for?
- What would make them recommend it?

3. Product Decisions

### Metrics: Focus on growth

- Total registrations
- Active users
- Activity levels
- Cohort retention
- Revenue
- Net promotor score
